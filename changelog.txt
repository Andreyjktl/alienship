Version 0.3 - March 1, 2012
---------------------------
- Bottom Menu: If no menu is assigned in Admin > Appearance > Menus, no default menu is displayed. This keeps the default wp_page_menu from displaying and looking like crap. That menu is usually too big for this area. The Bottom Menu is meant to be small. This gives the option of not displaying the menu at all. Good if you’re doing menu related things in the footer widgets and don’t need it.
- Allow child themes.
- Redid the Top Menu in responsive mode to be more touch friendly. Increased font size and spacing of dropdown items. Removed bold text. Added the word “Menu” to the button to make it more obvious what it actually is to people who’ve never seen it before.
- Fixed Top Menu dropdown issue in responsive mode. Auto-expands dropdown menus now and displays in a nested view.
- Fixed padding/overflow issue with panel shortcode.
- Breadcrumbs
- Minor cosmetics
- Cleaned up old CSS
- Added block grids, courtesy of Zurb Foundation.
- Added Custom Walker for Top Nav and a fallback function to create/display a blank menu if a custom menu is not set. Removed jQuery code that built the dropdown elements.
- Removed self-closing tags that don’t need it in HTML5.
- Cleaned up header output via inc/cleanup.php
- Improved child theme friendliness.
- Changed post tag and post category display. Now uses the Bootstrap label to wrap each category and/or tag.
- Removed display of categories and tags on index page. It’s just too busy. I might make this optional later.
