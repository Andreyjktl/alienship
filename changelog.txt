== Changelog ==


Version 0.3 - February
------------------------------
- Top Menu: Fixed problem with menu not displaying properly and dropdowns not working if WordPress was falling back on the wp_page_menu when a menu wasn't assigned in Admin > Appearance > Menus. Added jQuery code to js/alienship_dropdown-toggle.js to fix.
- Bottom Menu: If no menu is assigned in Admin > Appearance > Menus, the menu is not displayed. This keeps the default wp_page_menu from display and looking like crap. That menu is usually too big for this area. The Bottom Menu is meant to be small. This gives the option of not displaying the menu at all. Good if you're doing menu related things in the footer widgets and don't need it.
- Allow child themes.
- Redid the Top Menu in responsive mode. This is probably only temporary, as I'm still not happy with it. It is more touch friendly, though. Added a the word "Menu" to the button. Increased font size and spacing of dropdown items. Removed bold text.
- Kinda changed up the item above this one. Fixed Top Menu dropdown issue in responsive mode by changing classes with jQuery, from sub-menu to dropdown-menu. Auto-expands dropdown menus now and displays in a nested view.
- Fixed padding/overflow issue with [panel] shortcode.
- Breadcrumbs
- Minor cosmetics
- Cleaned up old CSS



Version 0.2 - February 6, 2012
------------------------------

- Fixed dropdown menu naming requirement.
- Added footer sidebar area.
- Fixed dropdown menu collapse bug when resizing browser.
- Fixed dropdown caret indicator.
- Added shortcodes for alerts, buttons, labels, panels, and wells.
- Removed left sidebar page template for now.
- Added Hero page template with Hero Widgets area.
- Added CSS classes show-on-phones, show-on-tablets, show-on-desktops, hide-on-phones, hide-on-tablets, hide-on-desktops to do exactly what it sounds like they do. Credit goes to Zurb and their Foundation framework. Will be cleaning this up a bit later.
- Added bottom navigation menu.
- Changed margins and font sizes for hero-unit class when on mobiles and tablets.
- Added support for custom/custom.css to allow for custom CSS that won't get killed on upgrades for those who don't or can't do child themes.

- Framework prep work (lots to do here. just getting started): 
 -- Moved sidebar functions to inc/sidebars.php
 -- Moved loading of Bootstrap javascript to inc/bootstrap-js.php
 -- Moved loading of jQuery dropdown toggle code to inc/bootstrap-js.php
