Thanks to the original authors of Twitter's Bootstrap and Automattic's _s theme, and everyone else who has contributed to both and to the included libraries and assets.




Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.

To get familiar with the features -- checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!
