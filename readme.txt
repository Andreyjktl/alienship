Alien Ship WordPress Theme
--------------------------

Alien Ship is an HTML5 responsive starter theme for WordPress. It uses Twitter's Bootstrap version 2.x. It comes with core HTML, CSS, and Javascript for type, form, grids, navigation, buttons, dropdown menus, and more. It includes a number of shortcodes to enable quick placement of buttons, labels, alerts, panels, wells, etc. Visit http://www.johnparris.com/alienship/ to see the theme in action, to download it, or to read the documentation.

Known Issues
------------

+ You can't really have a Top Menu and a Main Menu at the same time if you're using responsive layout. This is because they both use the same styling and the responsive button and javascript toggles both menus. This is actually on purpose as an option is coming that will enable either the Top Menu or the Main Menu. Both won't be an option. So for now, if you're using responsive, you need to make a choice of Top or Main. I might change this in later versions to enable two menus, but the current styling doesn't really work well for the user experience. It's just awkward to have two menu buttons without any other indicators as to the difference. Still thinking about this one.
